;;; CLIMDOC: An emacs interface the the Harlequin CLIM-2.0 reference

;; Requires FSF emacs 20.3 or greater

;; Written by Larry Hunter, LHunter@nih.gov on July 27, 1999.  This is
;; a US Government work, and is uncopyrightable.

;; To use this program, place this file in your load path, optionally
;; byte-compile it, and bind the function CLIMDOC to a convenient key (I use
;; \C-h\z myself).

;; I use CLIMDOC as a supplement to the hyperspec browser written by Erik
;; Naggum (http://sourcery.naggum.no/emacs/hyperspec.el).  

;; CLIMDOC is the user interface.  It will pop up a browser window on the CLIM
;; documentation for the argument (which can be read with completion from
;; the minibuffer, with default being the symbol near point).
